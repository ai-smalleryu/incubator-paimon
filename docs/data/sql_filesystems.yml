# INSTRUCTIONS:
#
# In order to add a new connector/format add a new entry to this file.
# You need specify a name that will be used in e.g. the description of the connector/format and
# a category (either "format" or "connector"). The category determines which table will the entry
# end up in on the Download page. The "maven" parameter describes the name of the maven module. The
# three parameters are required.
#
# If you specify "builtin=true" the corresponding table on the connector/format will not contain
# a link, but just a "Built-in" entry. If the built-in is set to true you do not need to provide the
# sql_url.
#
# If a connector comes with different versions for the external system, you can put those under a
# "versions" property. Each entry in the "versions" section should have a "version", which
# determines name for the version and "maven" and "sql_url" entries for that particular version.
# If you use the "versions" property, "maven" and "sql_url" should not be present in the top level
# section of the connector. (Multiple versions are supported only for the connector for now. If you
# need multiple versions support for formats, please update downloads.md)
#
# NOTE: You can use the variables $scala_version and $version in "sql_url" and "maven" properties.
